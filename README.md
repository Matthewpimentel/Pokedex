# PokeDex
This app provides information on all pokemon as well as all items in the pokemon series.
# What I learned
1. I learned how to receive data from an api and display the data in html
2. I expanded on my knowledge of react by using React hooks such as useState
3. I looked into bootstrap and also used it
# To do:
1. Implement a search function that you can get more in depth details about a pokemon
2. Implement information on habitats
3. Possibly provide the option to save pokemon in a list
